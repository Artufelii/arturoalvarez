						Iâ€™m a web developer, I started my career by learning code by myself, and since I began to learn I have worked on many personal projects and also as a freelance for startups here in my country, I have a great enthusiasm for work with great companies worldwide and to learn their professional practices to become a better developer, so I hope that we can work together on many projects.
